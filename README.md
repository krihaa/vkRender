# vkRender

This is a work in progress library to make it quick and easy to create vulkan applications.
Currently at very early stages, breaking changes will occur often.

To build and run this you need the Vulkan SDK: https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/ and update CMakeLists.txt to target your installation.
Currently only runs on Windows.
